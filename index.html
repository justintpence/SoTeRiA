<p>I am part of a multidisciplinary team of researchers in the <a href="http://soteria.npre.illinois.edu//">Socio-Technical Risk Analysis (SoTeRiA) Laboratory</a> Directed by Prof. Zahra Mohaghegh, and am pursuing a PhD in <a href="https://www.informatics.illinois.edu/">Informatics</a> advised by Prof. Mohaghegh. SoTeRiA Laboratory is advancing Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), a systematic risk methodology for modeling the emerging risk from the interactions of equipment failure and human error in complex systems. SoTeRiA Laboratory includes experts from multiple engineering departments who focus on the physical failure mechanisms of components and equipment. Alongside my team, I assess the social failure mechanisms in the multi-dimensional chains of accident sequences. Simply stated, my research evaluates performance of the humans and organizations responsible for managing, maintaining and operating complex systems, and explores the scenarios and conditions which have the potential to create undesirable consequences for other humans,  organizations, and populations.</p>

<p>The evolution of our species is inextricably linked with technology. In order to advance technologically, a certain level of risk must be taken. This scale of risk should be commensurate with social acceptance, and evaluated by the costs, effectiveness, efficiency and equity of a sustainable socio-technical future. The vision for utilizing risk information in decision making goes beyond its current use in high-consequence industry applications, toward a more holistic and risk-informed approach for designing and planning for the forthcoming interactions of technology and society.</p>
